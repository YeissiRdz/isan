            <h3 class="list-h">Student Data Protection</h3>
            <p>Ensure that all student personal information is protected and only accessible by authorized personnel.</p>
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This involves implementing robust security measures, such as encryption systems for data storage and transmission, role-based restricted access controls, and periodic audits to detect possible vulnerabilities. In addition, it is essential to comply with privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Federal Personal Data Protection Law, as applicable, to ensure that sensitive data, such as academic information, medical records or data from contact, are handled ethically and in accordance with applicable laws. Educating staff on secure data handling practices is also essential to prevent unauthorized access or improper disclosure.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 2">
            <h3 class="list-h">Consent to Use of Data</h3>
            <p>Obtain explicit consent from parents or guardians before collecting, storing, or sharing personal data about students.</p>
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This includes clearly and thoroughly informing parents or guardians about the purpose of data collection, how it will be used, who will have access to it, and for how long it will be stored. It is essential that consent is voluntary, informed and documented, often through signed forms or secure digital platforms. Also, the option to revoke consent at any time should be provided and ensure that students' privacy rights are respected. Complying with these practices not only strengthens trust between educational institutions and families, but also ensures compliance with applicable data protection laws.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 3">
            <h3 class="list-h">Restricted Access to Information</h3>
            <p>Limit access to academic records and confidential data to relevant and authorized personnel only.</p>
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This requires the implementation of role-based access control systems, where each staff member can only view or handle the information strictly necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities. In addition, it is essential to use tools such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication and activity logs to monitor who is accessing data and when. These measures not only prevent unauthorized access, but also help track potential security breaches. Ongoing staff training in the responsible handling of confidential information is equally crucial to maintaining high standards of security and privacy within the institution.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 4">
            <h3 class="list-h">Responsible Use of Technologies</h3>
            <p>Regulate the use of electronic devices and digital platforms to protect the privacy and safety of students.</p>
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This implies establishing clear policies on the permitted use of electronic devices, such as phones, tablets and computers, within the educational environment, ensuring that their use is exclusively for academic purposes. In addition, restrictions on access to digital platforms should be implemented, ensuring that only approved tools that meet high security and privacy standards are used. It is also important to educate students and staff about the risks associated with inappropriate use of technology, such as phishing, cyberbullying or exposure to inappropriate content, and to encourage safe practices, such as creating strong passwords and regularly updating software. These actions not only protect students' personal information, but also promote a safe and ethical digital environment.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 5">
            <h3 class="list-h">Do Not Share Information Without Authorization</h3>.
            <p>Prohibit the disclosure of students' personal information to third parties without the explicit permission of parents or guardians.</p>
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This includes establishing strict procedures for handling requests for information, ensuring that any disclosure is supported by written consent and complies with applicable legal regulations. In addition, educational institutions should keep detailed records of when, how and to whom information is shared, providing an additional level of accountability and transparency. It is also essential to train staff on the importance of protecting student privacy, highlighting the legal and ethical consequences of unauthorized data sharing. These measures reinforce families' confidence in the responsible handling of personal information within the educational environment.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 6">
            <h3 class="list-h">Secure Password Management</h3>.
            <p>Require strong, unique passwords for accessing school systems and train staff and students in good security practices.
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This involves establishing policies that require passwords with an appropriate level of complexity, such as including a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters, as well as a recommended minimum length. It is also important to implement procedures for the regular change of passwords and to avoid their reuse in different systems. Institutions should incorporate tools such as password managers and multifactor authentication to further strengthen access security. In parallel, it is essential to educate students and staff on the importance of not sharing their passwords, recognizing phishing attempts and keeping their devices protected, promoting a strong cybersecurity culture in the school environment.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 7">
            <h3 class="list-h">Periodic Policy Review</h3>.
            <p>Regularly update privacy policies to ensure compliance with local and national regulations.
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This involves establishing a schedule for reviewing and revising privacy policies in response to legislative changes, technological advances or new security risks. During these reviews, it is critical to assess the effectiveness of current policies, identify areas for improvement and ensure that they reflect best practices in data protection. In addition, legal and technology experts should be involved to ensure that policies comply with applicable regulations, such as the GDPR or the Personal Data Protection Act. Clearly communicating changes to all stakeholders, including students, parents and staff, is essential to maintain transparency and trust in the handling of personal information.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 8">
            <h3 class="list-h">Confidentiality in School Meetings</h3>.
            <p>Ensure that information discussed in meetings between parents, teachers, and students is treated with complete confidentiality.
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This requires establishing clear rules to ensure that any information shared in these meetings, whether about academic performance, special needs or personal situations, is not disclosed outside the authorized scope. Participants should be informed of the importance of maintaining confidentiality and, if necessary, sign agreements that reinforce this commitment. In addition, practical measures should be implemented, such as holding meetings in private and secure environments, avoiding the use of unauthorized devices to record or share information, and documenting only what is strictly necessary for institutional purposes. These actions not only protect the privacy of students and their families, but also promote an environment of trust and mutual respect in the school community.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 9">
            <h3 class="list-h">Transparency in Data Use</h3>.
            <p>Clearly inform parents and students about how and why their personal data is collected and used.</p>
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This involves providing detailed and accessible information through privacy policies, informational brochures or digital platforms, explaining the purpose of data collection, the types of information collected, how it will be stored, who will have access to it and for how long it will be retained. In addition, institutions should detail the security measures implemented to protect the data and specify the rights of parents and students, such as access, rectification or deletion of their personal information. Maintaining open communication and responding promptly to any questions or concerns reinforces confidence in the responsible management of personal data within the educational environment.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-li" style="--i: 10">
            <h3 class="list-h">Reporting Channels</h3>
            <p>Establish secure channels for students and parents to report any privacy violations in a confidential manner.
            <p class="list-p"><strong>This includes creating accessible and secure mechanisms, such as dedicated phone lines, protected online forms or physical mailboxes, that allow students and parents to submit complaints or concerns about potential privacy violations without fear of retaliation. It is critical to ensure that these channels are available at all times and are easy to use, as well as provide clear guidance on how to file a report. Procedures should also be established to investigate and resolve these complaints in a timely and transparent manner, ensuring that those responsible are informed of the actions taken. By implementing these channels, institutions build trust and demonstrate their commitment to protecting the privacy and rights of students.</strong></p>
